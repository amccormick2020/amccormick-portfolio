Welcome to my Software Engineering Portfolio Web App! You can access it at the following link:

http://austin-mccormick.com

My portfolio features the SWE skills I've picked up along with my education, professional experience, projects, and resume.

I built this application using the following:
- Javascript
- React.js
- Node.js
- Docker
- AWS

To build and view my portfolio locally using Docker, run the following from the project directory:
1) docker build -t portfolio .
2) docker run -p 8000:3000 portfolio

project will be visible at http://localhost:8000/

To build and view my portfolio locally using Node.js directly, run the following from the project directory:
1) npm install
2) npm start

project will be visible at http://localhost:3000/
